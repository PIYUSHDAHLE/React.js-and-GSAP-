What is Axios?
----------------
Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or a Node.js environment. 

It provides an easy-to-use API for performing actions like getting data from a server (GET requests), sending data to a server (POST requests), updating resources (PUT/PATCH requests), and deleting resources (DELETE requests). 

Itâ€™s commonly used in modern web development, especially in applications built with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
